# Front-End Dev - React I

This is a take-home test that is expected to offer flexibility and ease to the potential candidate. Other than that, we expect the candidate to uphold the integrity and trust of this test, and to perform to the best of their capabilities without being unfaithful to their own selves.

# Test Description:

The candidate is expected to use React as a mandatory library and can use it with any styling framework (Bootstrap would be preferred). The use of Styled Components with any of the selected styling frameworks or libraries is compulsory.
